Instructions for execution:

1 - Create a config file int the following format:

10							# Number of nodes
0 net30.utdallas.edu 5550	# {Node Id, host name, port number} tuples
1 net31.utdallas.edu 5551
2 net32.utdallas.edu 5552
3 net33.utdallas.edu 5553
4 net34.utdallas.edu 5554
5 net35.utdallas.edu 5555
6 net36.utdallas.edu 5556
7 net37.utdallas.edu 5557
8 net38.utdallas.edu 5558
9 net39.utdallas.edu 5559

2 - Run the makefile to build the executable.

3 - Open terminals in the nodes mentioned in the config file and run the executable
	generated by the makefile as follows:
	
	<executable name> <Node number> <config file path>
	
	Note 1: When starting the nodes, make sure to execute sequentially, 
			i.e, 0->1->2->so on on the respective machines.
	Note 2: Make sure to have different port numbers in config file if localhost 
			is being used for execution.
			
****************************************************************************************************
Outputs:
	
1 - Output file name logs.txt showing entry into the critical section are generated.
2 - Data Collection files capturing number of messages exchanged and time required
	for each critical section access for odd and even numbered nodes are generated.
	
****************************************************************************************************
Macros used in Messages.h

1 - MAX_NUM_NODES 		- 	This should be changed if more nodes are in the system.
2 - NUM_CS_ACCESSES		- 	Number of Critical Section accesses in each stage(2 stages) per node.
3 - WAIT_MIN			- 	Minimum Wait duration for the first NUM_CS_ACCESSES CS accesses 
							for both even and odd numbered nodes.
4 - WAIT_MAX			- 	Maximum Wait duration for the first NUM_CS_ACCESSES CS accesses 
							for both even and odd numbered nodes.		
5 - WAIT_MIN_EVEN		- 	Minimum Wait duration for the second NUM_CS_ACCESSES CS accesses 
							for even numbered nodes.	
6 - WAIT_MAX_EVEN		- 	Maximum Wait duration for the second NUM_CS_ACCESSES CS accesses 
							for even numbered nodes.
